# This script documents 
# how to install Windows Subsystem for Linux (Ubuntu) in your Windows 10 or higher computer
# how to setup your Ubuntu 
# how to install Stacks 2.60 ; and
# how to manipulate your $PATH variable

# Download Ubuntu application in the Microsoft Store
# set-up your username and password (invisible)

# After setting up, install Windows Terminal application in your computer
# this application allows you to have multiple windows of ubuntu terminal 

# Now that you have your Ubuntu ready for set-up
# Open Ubuntu in your Windows Terminal and check your present working directory

$ pwd

# You will notice that your pwd looks something like this /mnt/c/Users/mendiomi
# This mean that your root directory starts from /mnt/path/to/your/files

## Setting up your Ubuntu

$ sudo apt-get update -y
$ sudo apt install build-essential

# we are basically installing all the updates and essential packages in your ubuntu. YES to all installation questions.

# here are some of the essential packages for Stacks 2.60, so we are going to install it now:

# install gpp
$ sudo apt-get install -y gpp

# install Zlib compression
$ sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev 

# Now that your Ubuntu is ready

## Let's install Stacks version 2.60

# Download the the tar.gz file of Stacks here: https://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/
# Move tar.gz file to your desired folder
# Go to your ubuntu terminal and go to the directory where you placed your tar.gz

# run commands

# decompress file
$ tar xfvz stacks-2.60.tar.gz
$ cd stacks-2.60/
$ ./configure --prefix=/mnt/path/to/your/desired/directory
$ make -j 8

# check executables and other files in your directory
$ ls
# you should see all of the files and executables in the directory

# Now, try if you can call out the executables

$ ustacks

# If if does not work, try including the root directories

$ /mnt/path/to/your/desired/directory/ustacks

# You should see the program information/manual appearing on your terminal

# Because if is hard to call your prgrams with long directories

## This is how to set your $PATH or environment so you can call your programs even you are not in the current directory where you put them

# Terporarily manipulate your $PATH variable

$ echo $PATH
> /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/mnt/c/WINDOWS/system32:/mnt/c/WINDOWS:/mnt/c/WINDOWS/System32/Wbem:/mnt/c/WINDOWS/System32/WindowsPowerShell/v1.0/:/mnt/c/GCsolution/Program:/mnt/c/GCMSSO~1/Program:/mnt/c/WINDOWS/System32/OpenSSH/:/mnt/c/Program Files/PuTTY/:/mnt/c/Users/mendiomi/AppData/Local/Microsoft/WindowsApps:/snap/bin

$ PATH=$PATH:/opt/bin
$ echo $PATH

# You will see at that you added something at the end

# Now try it using your current working directory

$ PATH=$PATH:/mnt/c/Users/mendiomi/installation/stacks-2.60
$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/mnt/c/WINDOWS/system32:/mnt/c/WINDOWS:/mnt/c/WINDOWS/System32/Wbem:/mnt/c/WINDOWS/System32/WindowsPowerShell/v1.0/:/mnt/c/GCsolution/Program:/mnt/c/GCMSSO~1/Program:/mnt/c/WINDOWS/System32/OpenSSH/:/mnt/c/Program Files/PuTTY/:/mnt/c/Users/mendiomi/AppData/Local/Microsoft/WindowsApps:/snap/bin:/opt/bin:/mnt/c/Users/mendiomi/installation/stacks-2.60
# You temporarily set the $PATH variable on your current directory

# Now, try to go to the root directory

$ cd ~

# and call your Stacks programs (ustacks, process_radtags, cstacks)

$ process_radtags

# You should see the manual of process_radtags

# We can permanently change the $PATH variable by manipulating the .bashrc file 

# open the nano text file editor and paste the path of the directory where the executables are located 
$ nano .bashrc

# Go to the bottom of the file and paste the path (PATH=$PATH:/mnt/c/Users/mendiomi/installation/stacks-2.60)

# Write out (^O) the file (save) and exit.
# Create another ubuntu windows and try to call your programs
# done


## additional commands for setting up Ubuntu
## How to mount your external drive (network drives) on WSL Ubuntu

# create a directory

$ mkdir /mnt/Z

# mount the drive

$ sudo mount -t drvfs M: /mnt/Z
